  <h1>DOMINIC G. MAMUCUD</h1>
  <h2>Born: April 30, 2000</h2>

      <p>
        Dominic Ganosa Mamucud here. I go by the names "Dom" or "Nik." I reside in Isabela's Bliss Village City of Ilagan. My parents' names are Lotie Ganosa Mamucud and Domingo Tarayao Mamucud. I have 4 sisters named Venus, Mars, Neptune, and
        Mercury, as well as 1 brother named Mark Daniel, making a total of 6 siblings. I attend Isabela State University's Ilagan City Campus as well. Bachelor of Science in Information Technology is the course I'm enrolled in (BSIT). Cooking,
        playing mobile games, and watching anime like One Piece, One Punch Man, and other series are some of my favorite pastimes.
        <br> Basketball and skateboarding are two of my favorite sports. The Tau Gamma Phi Fraternity also counts me among its members.<br>
        I do provide vaping supplies for sale.
        My own business is this. It's been operational since 2019. Furthermore,<br> I have a girlfriend. Marie Angelique Angoluan is the name of my girlfriend, and she attends Isabela State University as well. We have been dating since 2020 and are
        still going strong.<br>
        I also have a hobby that I need to give up: participating in drag racing as a rider. I used to enjoy participating in automobile drag racing when I was in high school and senior high school, but now that I am a college student, I need to quit
        doing that in order to concentrate on my studies.<br>
        My pet dog is a girl named Catriona Black, and I gave her that name because she was born on the day that Catriona Gray won Ms. Universe 2018. Additionally, I work a part-time job as a waiter and food server in the catering industry. Being a
        working student is challenging, but I'm proud of myself because I can pay for my wants out of my own money. However, I left my employment in order to concentrate on my studies because I was unable to do so last semester, and the worst part is
        that I almost failed my two major subjects. But I did learn a valuable lesson: I should prioritize my schooling over my part-time employment.<br>
        Also in additional after you saw me in personal maybe you say’s to me i'm sort of a person because this can be the foremost impressions people says to me but when land know me deeper that's the alternative me because i’m a awfully humble,
        friendly and sort person.<br>
        I can be your best friend i you want to but i have one rule if you want to be my friend don’t backstabbing me or anybody in front of somebody better if you just confront right me or them right away because in short i hate a backstabber people
        but if you can’t do my golden rule better not to be my friend because we can’t get along well if you cant do my golden rule. And this can be my story about my self i hope you enjoy and luxuriate in my story about my self

    Edson is the kind of person who does more and speaks less. He rarely talks about his plans because he knows that people will respect him more if they heard the results of his hard work first, more than that he's trying to level up every single
    day. I can see in him the work ethic of my grandparents and the discipline of today's generation combined which are the ingredients of success in every circumstance he face.
